Hey Mr.

Its a Windows-Form ASP.NET C# program.
To run this make sure you have required .NET FRAMEWORK installed.
Database MS-SQL is connected. Run the SQL script in MS SQL.
Sample output image is also in the folder.

UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO SHORTAGE OF TIME I COULD NOT SET UP THE PROJECT AS PER REQUIRMENTS(NAME).
You can contat me anytime for any kind of queries.

I hope you are happy with the task & dont forget to reach me for your other projects.
It was great experience working with you.
Regards Huzaifa
